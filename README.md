### I'm a software developer

Graduated in Information Systems from the University of Southern Santa Catarina, with two specializations: Project Management and Internet of Things.

Works as a software engineer in architecture oriented to microservices. Currently, super focused on the Golang programming language and evolving DevOps skills.

I'm founder and coordinator of [whiteStone_dev](https://whitestonedev.com.br/) (group of software developers from Pedra Branca - Palho√ßa), which aims to disseminate knowledge and encourage new developers.

More than 8 years with software development where I had experience with other programming languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, C#, PHP and Javascript. I highly values clean architecture, project organization and layout, agile development methods and eXtreme Programming practices.

With soft skills of teamwork, flexibility, communication between peers, feedback culture and motivated to engage the team and achieve results.

In constant learning in the world of technology and software development.

When I am not programming I like to meet my friends, drink some beers :beers: and play the piano :musical_keyboard:
